      <description>At some point during the lockdown it was announced that we could meet in groups of no more than 8 in an outdoor setting. This meant that we would need to have knowledge of where we could meet our friends for the first time in an age. I’m sure we know of our local and well frequented boozers; but what about those that have outdoor seating? How would we know where to meet our friends?</description>

      <description>The NHS website does not display vaccine centres on a map. How can I know what centres are near me? Answer: scrape the centres and display them all. This does require you to know where you are on a map, but for now, it’s much nicer to visualise.</description>
